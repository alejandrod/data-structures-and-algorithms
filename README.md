# data-structures-and-algorithms

WIP: work in progress!!

Notes for: [https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/)

Note: in some cases the code is writing in a way to explicitly denote what we are doing and the algorithm behind it, 
avoiding some scala utilities.
